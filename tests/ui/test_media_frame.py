"""
Tests for the MediaFrame VLC deadlock fix for Matroska files missing a Cues element.

Without a Cues (seek-index) element, libvlc_media_player_stop() blocks indefinitely
because VLC performs a sequential linear scan of the file and that decode loop never
cleanly exits when interrupted.

Two complementary behaviours are in place:
  1. video_stop() runs stop() in a daemon thread with a 3-second timeout.  On
     timeout the hung player is replaced and the file path is recorded in
     _matroska_missing_cues_paths.
  2. show_video() checks _matroska_missing_cues_paths and sets the no-seek indicator
     in MediaControlsOverlay for known-bad paths — the seek slider is disabled and a
     warning label is shown.  VLC still plays the file (it can play but not seek).
